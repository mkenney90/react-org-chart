# react-org-chart
A visual organizational hierarchy chart built in React.js

The app fetches employee data from a JSON file and builds an interactive interface based on individual rankings.

Clicking on an employee node rebuilds the org chart starting at the selected employee. Alternatively, you can enter the employee's name in the text field above the chart.


### TODO:

*Add support for employee profile pictures/portraits

*Add support for custom color themes created by the user

*Cleanup hanging node connectors beneath employees with no subordinates
